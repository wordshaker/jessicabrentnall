Hi readers. It's been a while.

When I started my role officially as a Head of Architecture November last year, I made a concious decision to focus on it; and to develop myself working in this role. This meant that I decreased the amount of "extra" work I did outside work. Admittedly, it was further helped by the abstract for the talk I wanted to do this year not being accepted by a single conference. In the end, that turned out for the best.

This decision has had some impacts I will have to work myself back from. I'm no longer part of the MVP Program, having decreased my comintributions to the community. I've not been as present at events, and hence my network has suffered. These are all things I will try to regain when (or if) I have the energy to do so. My physical and mental health are always a balance; and with my tendency to burn myself out, I didn't want to do it this time. Especially, as now I am responsible for more and directly for some people, my burnout would not only impact myself.

## What was the change?

Previous to this, I was a Senior Principal Architect on the "Individual Contributor" career track. I put quotations around Individual Contributor as if I'm being honest, that's never really how I conducted my role. As an Architect, I've always aimed to work on a consultative basis. For some aspects I am an SME, but I get the most out of my role by supporting and building up the professions around me. I have always tried to improve engagement across the departments and specialities, helped guide engineers in appropriate strategies and why certain decisions are the most appropriate. It's part of the reason I love architecture, I get to work in two areas I enjoy. I get to think about long term, strategic challenges and how to solve them technically. I also get to train and mentor others, acting as a catalyst for their development and potential.

As a Senior Principal, I worked across many products, domains and teams. I got to work at all levels; from working with individual teams on their solutions through to engaging with long term business and client needs; identifying what needs to be done to meet these concerns.

As a Head of Architecture, I still do all that was encompassed in my old role, but with the added accountability of running the Architecture function (specifically Digital / Technical Architecture).

## What have I learned?

## What is next?

_Keep up the great efforts_
