Hi readers. It's been a while.

When I started my role officially as a Head of Architecture November last year, I made a concious decision to focus on it; and to develop myself working in this role. This meant that I decreased the amount of "extra" work I did outside work. Admittedly, it was further helped by the abstract for the talk I wanted to do this year not being accepted by a single conference. In the end, that turned out for the best.

This decision has had some impacts I will have to work myself back from. I'm no longer part of the MVP Program, having decreased my comintributions to the community. I've not been as present at events, and hence my network has suffered. These are all things I will try to regain when (or if) I have the energy to do so. My physical and mental health are always a balance; and with my tendency to burn myself out, I didn't want to do it this time. Especially, as now I am responsible for more and directly for some people, my burnout would not only impact myself.

## What was the change?

Previous to this, I was a Senior Principal Architect on the "Individual Contributor" career track. I put quotations around Individual Contributor as if I'm being honest, that's never really how I conducted my role. As an Architect, I've always aimed to work on a consultative basis. For some aspects I am an SME, but I get the most out of my role by supporting and building up the professions around me. I have always tried to improve engagement across the departments and specialities, helped guide engineers in appropriate strategies and why certain decisions are the most appropriate. It's part of the reason I love architecture, I get to work in two areas I enjoy. I get to think about long term, strategic challenges and how to solve them technically. I also get to train and mentor others, acting as a catalyst for their development and potential.

As a Senior Principal, I worked across many products, domains and teams. I got to work at all levels; from working with individual teams on their solutions through to engaging with long term business and client needs; identifying what needs to be done to meet these concerns.

As a Head of Architecture, I still do all that was encompassed in my old role, but with the added accountability of running the Architecture function (specifically Digital / Technical Architecture). This includes line management of individuals, capacity and succession planning, capability mapping, supporting training and progression, improving engagement models, planning and management of work; to name just a few of the team focused activities. I have also had more input into the overall strategy of the platform, planning long term / strategic items of work, ensuring compliance across the platform and managing stakeholders at a senior leadership and client level.

It a big job and a big responsibility. The list above is the tip of the iceberg of the list on what I actually work on on a day to day basis. It's required a shift in mind set and how I self manage my work and capacity.

## What have I learned?

### Being liked is not as useful as being respected.

### Being a martyr helps nobodies cause.

### Good stakeholder engagement and planning avoids a lot of future headache.

### How to adapt to feedback loops.


## What is next?

_Looking forward to the future_
