### Why this might be helpful

Google enables you to change your targeted adverts so you can indicate what you do and don't want to see. There are numerous reasons why I think this is and amazing feature.

First, there is gender targeted adverts. There are many sites that use this option. One example is Facebook. I have known many people who, fed up of seeing adverts related to dating sites and makeup because they have ticked the female box when signing up for a site, changed their settings to male so they could see tech and sports adverts instead.

There is a bigger reason why I think this is a great feature. There are many reasons why you might want to stop certain adverts displaying. I'll use a personal example. As a 27 year old woman, for the last few years a lot of the adverts shown to me have been related to fertility, parenting and babies in general. Due to medical reasons, it's ill advised for me to ever have children. This can sometimes be very difficult. Having the option to remove these adverts has been a big life improvement.

There are many reasons why you might not want to see certain adverts. Here's a guide on how to change your Google ad's to help make life a bit better.

### Steps to changing your adverts

- Go into your account settings. This can be done by clicking on your avatar in the far right corner and clicking on 'My Account'.

</div>

- Click on Ad Settings and navigate to manage add settings.

</div>

- Here you can list the topics you like to see and those you don't like to see.

</div>

- Here is what the list of topics looks like if you want to to remove parenting and babies from your targeted adverts. There is also the option of turning off targeted ad's but I am not sure what the user experience would be like.

<div style="text-align:center; width:80%; margin-left: 10%;" markdown="1">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/2018/02-18/step4.png" alt="Tools">
</div>

#### And that's it

Happy Googling.
