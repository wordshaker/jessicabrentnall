        <h2>Outreach</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Mentoring</b></p>
          <p>Outside of work I mentor anywhere between 2 - 4 people. This normally consists of once a month coaching sessions but can be more or less regular depending on need</p>
          <p><b>Supporting Second Year Projects for The University of Nottingham (2018 - 2020)</b></p>
          <p>I project managed second-year projects for The University Of Nottingham. This involved coming up with the projects, coordinating with the university, organising workshops, managing the mentors of the project, making sure the work was on track and that both the company and students were getting the most out of the experience.</p>
          <p><b>Q&A Sessions & advocacy for School Of Code (2019 - present)</b><p><a href="https://blog.schoolofcode.co.uk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">School Of Code</a> has been running since 2019 and for all cohorts of students I have ran an "untweetable truth" Q&A session. I am a huge supporter of this initiative and am very vocal about it on all social media.</p>
          <p><b>Careers Fairs at Local Secondary Schools (2017 - 2018)</p></b><p>I have ran stalls at a couple of careers fairs promoting the local tech community and jobs to secondary school students.</p>
