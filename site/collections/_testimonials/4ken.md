blurb: Jess is a leader and someone who can deliver on her promises. She can talk the talk but more importantly is that when she does talk the talk, she walks the walk to back it up. She has been known to go out of her way to spend time with team members to help them improve to her own detriment and she can carry her heart on her sleeve sometimes, but this is not a negative as it just shows the level of passion that she brings with any job she does. She’s passionate about coding standards and best practices, and she’s helped teach the whole department about better security practices.
